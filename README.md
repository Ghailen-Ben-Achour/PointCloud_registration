# PointCloud_registration
This work is based on [ICP registration tutorial](http://www.open3d.org/docs/latest/tutorial/Basic/icp_registration.html).
## Usage
```geometric_features.py``` allows to visualize and extract the geometric features of the source point cloud (in yellow) as well as the target (in blue).
```bash
python geometric_features.py --voxel_size [default value is 0.05]
```
